This is a personal finance web-app. The idea is to upload transaction data from your online accounts, in QIF format, and use this to track monthly spending patterns. It lets you categorize
transactions by either matching, or manually updating. Then you can view spending patterns over
any period of time. Also all the account data is stored *locally*, that is the app is completely client side, so there are no privacy implications.

A live demo is available at [here](https://drufino.github.io/finance_app/index.html). Bear in mind you will some QIF data in order to make it interesting!

Running in development mode should be straight-forward, simply install node and run 'npm start'
